## Introduction

The symmetric group \( S_3 \) has six elements, which can be represented as permutations of the set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\). This project aims to provide a clear and concise way to generate the Cayley table for \( S_3 \) using Python. This project was done during our time at Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Scholars Program.
